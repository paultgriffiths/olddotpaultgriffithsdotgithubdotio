I am an atmospheric chemist and work in the Long-Term Global Change Directorate of the UK's National Centre for Atmospheric Science.  My research interests are in modelling chemistry-climate feedbacks, and in the evolution of atmospheric composition more generally.  

I am also Senior Research Fellow in Climate Science at Robinson College, Cambridge.  Before NCAS, I worked in cloud modelling, aerosol chemistry and various aspects of chemical physics.
