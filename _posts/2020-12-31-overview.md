Second half of 2020 was spent almost entirely on CMIP6 work.

## Talks
- UKESM GA talk
- ACSIS meeting presentation on OH and CH4 in CCMI REFC1SD simulations

## Project meetings
- Meeting with Cornelius Zetsch and Rolf Sander on tropospheric Cl fields
- Meeting with Rob Jackson, Sam Abernathy and Cambridge on methane in SSPs
- hosted UKESM1/AerChemMIP analysis workshop
- H2 meetings
- CMIP6 ozone project paper meetings


## H2 economy
- rederive formula for CH4 levels given feedback factors and lifetime changes as in West et al. 2009
- H2 project meetings


## Schmidt Data for Science residency
- One of approx thirty researchers selected to take part in a [five-week residency in data science techniques](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/news/schmidt-data-science-residency-programme) as applied to scientific research problems.  

## UKCA SMG
- Work on UKCA User developer policy
- UKCA user survey

## Supervision of project on ozone budgets
- drawing on Bates and Jacob, 2020.

## Code / Science
- update figures for Fiona O'Connor's ERF paper
- ozone budget and burden analysis for histSST-piVOC and histSST-piNOx experiments
- ERF for H2 economy emissions changes
- work on feedback factors in methane and H2 economy jobs
- work on STE in other models
- STE analysis for CMIP6 experiments
- 1960 CH4 methane attribution run
- work on STE in UKESM1
- Updates to David Wade's Samalas paper
- Updates to Fiona's ERF paper
- work on comparing UKESM1 with observations over Malaysia peninsula
- reviews for JAMES and Atmospheric Environment

### Finish CMIP6 updates
- STE calculations for GISS-E21-G, GFDL-ESM4 and UKESM1-0-LL
- emissions updates
- revised OPE calculations
- update Chapter 6 draft figure of evolution of ozone burden

## December frenzy
