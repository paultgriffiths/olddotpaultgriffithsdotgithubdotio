## New capability in UKESM1 has been used to simulate surface ozone

Working with Luke Abraham, we set up a new version of [UKESM1](https://www.ukesm.ac.uk) to simulate surface ozone at a resolution of ∼60 km (0.83 x 0.56 degree) spatial scale.  The movie shows hourly snapshots of the ozone field.
