Looking back on 2021, the first post CMIP6 year, with COVID disruptions continuing (lockdowns in early 2021, sold our house in June, moved out in September).  Some new responsibilities: more tutorial roles, service on College council, big teaching load in MT 2021.  Resident Fellow in Robinson for MT 2021.  

## New Centre for Atmospheric Science Data Driven Science Discussion Group
- [First repo!](https://github.com/Centre-for-Atmospheric-Science-Cam-Chem/best-practices-and-data-sources)

## Metrics paper
- responses to refereees 

## Code / Science
- development of new budget metrics for ozone production/destruction
- work with Dan Winter and Seb on new NAO metrics for ML
- work with Seb on ML with the TOAR ozone database
- contribution to the PDRMIP/RFMIP/AerChemMIP TriMIPAthlon
- evaluation of CMIP6 variables TAS,CLT,RSDS and AOD against observations for ACSIS E2E project
- MMM for other SSPs in CMIP6 experiments
- STE analysis for CMIP6 experiments

## Presentations

## H2 economy
- ERF and ozone budgets
- work on setting up new runs (box model)
- analysing ozone budgets
- Reff, CDNC, OH correlations with ERF
- Report writing, delivered November 2021

## ACSIS E2E work
- analysis of OH in CMIP6 models (interactive chem)
- analysis of O3 in Amon realm (model diversity)
- analysis of AOD550 in AERmon realm (looking for correlation with aerosol treatment)
- looking for online aerosol formation 

## Reviews
