Ines Heimann developed the model used for methane emissions analysed the chemistry-climate model data for the impacts on OH etc and prepared the emissions files.

I made the first version of the offline chemistry model used for emissions optimisation, ran the box model looking at chemical feedbacks, ran a simulation looking at CO emissions impact (Delta CO) and wrote the manuscript in collaboration with John Pyle.
